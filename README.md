# JS-JavaScript-FAQ-App

JS-JavaScript-FAQ-App is a web-based application built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript that presents frequently asked questions (FAQs) regarding JavaScript development. This app serves as a resource for users seeking answers to common JavaScript-related queries.

## Features

- Interactive FAQ Display: The app utilizes JavaScript to enable users to open and close articles containing the answers to each question, making efficient use of element selectors.
- CSS Design Theories: JS-JavaScript-FAQ-App explores various CSS design theories to enhance the visual appeal of the app.

## FAQ Topics

The app currently covers the following questions:

1. What is prototypical inheritance and how useful is it?
2. What does 'use strict' mean at the top of a block of code?
3. Where should I use the 'let' and 'const' keywords instead of 'var'?

## Preview

To see the JS-JavaScript-FAQ-App in action, you can check it out on [CodePen](https://codepen.io/j-pruitt/pen/VwGQbgW).

## Usage

- Click on the question titles to toggle the display of their respective answers.
- Utilize the '+' and '-' icons to open and close the articles containing the answers.

## How It Works

The app employs JavaScript event listeners to enable toggling the display of answers. When a question is clicked, the app checks the state of other questions and ensures that only one question's answer is displayed at a time.

## To-Do List

- Enhance Design: The app currently explores CSS design theories, but improvements can be made to create a more refined display. (Work in progress, no rush)
